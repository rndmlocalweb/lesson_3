		<h1>Ukrainian Power: Showcase of Ukrainian creative agencies</h1>
		<p id="top" class="first-text">
			The full-scale war against Ukraine takes away a lot: lives, peace, comfort, and resources. But it can't take
			away our drive to resist and rebuild Ukraine's economy for the win. <br> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.awwwards.com/sites/ukrainian-power">Ukrainian Power</a> is the project that unites the
			country's best creative forces that were left with little to no local clients. And now, to stay afloat, they
			are forced to fully enter the global market.
		</p>
		<p>Our mission was to help <mark>Ukrainian</mark> creative teams to make a smooth transition into the global industry. As well
			as to call international businesses to either partner with Ukrainian talent or to get ready to compete with it.
			The message may strike as provocative and even a bit aggressive. But it perfectly conveys how determined
			creatives are to work at 202% to keep their teams, provide for their families, and simply survive.</p>
		<img src="img/awwwards2.jpg" alt="Ukrainian Power Logo">
		<p>
			With this idea at the core, we launched a digital directory of Ukrainian agencies of various specializations
			for foreign businesses to choose from. It exclusively includes talent that proved their expertise and won
			international awards.
		</p>
		<h2>The website shows the international community what Ukrainian creatives go through and offers partnerships as a
			way to help Ukraine. We included 30+ Ukrainian agencies that can now have regular income from abroad"
			— Kyrylo Lazarev, CEO of Lazarev.agency</h2>

			<h3>Creative Directory</h3>
			<p>
				The website welcomes visitors with a catalog of Ukrainian agencies. The dynamic layout of companies is
				entirely
				random — we did it to create equal conditions for each of them. To enhance the site experience, we added
				team
				previews and filters for a quick search.
			</p>
			<p>
				When exploring a particular agency, the user goes to its page and can discover all the necessary
				information.
				Our focus on interactivity and engagement allows each talent to tell its story with maximum dynamics and
				minimum words. We added a hover effect showcasing agencies' show reels and highlights. The same goes with
				their
				awards to create some playful vibes.

			<h3>Ukrainian reality and creative potential </h3>
			<p>
				To build emotional connection with the audience on the About page, we went for visual design paired with the
				content flow. Red accents in a headline and text blocks express emotional pressure. Videos with war footage
				address Ukrainians' reality and their motivation to work for survival.
			</p>
			<p>
				Having passed this block, people stop at a choice point — to work with Ukrainian agencies and make them
				valuable assets or to compete. We made animated circles with 3D elements for interaction plus a tiny detail
				— a
				blurred hover effect to emphasize the website's primary purpose — partnership.

		<div id="faq">
			<h3>FAQ Page</h3>
			<p>
				The page provides users with the answers to questions they might have about our project. We also wanted to
				motivate other Ukrainian agencies to join the initiative, so we added a Google form for them to apply.
			</p>

		<div id="cross-device">
			<h3>Cross-device accebility</h3>
			<p>
				We made sure to fine-tune users' search experience and deliver the content regardless of the device. So
				people
				can explore the website in their comfort via smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

			<h4>Technologies</h4>
			<p>We developed the website in our go-to — the Webflow no-code tool. To create the desired effects, we took
				advantage of the platform's opportunities, combined with other technologies like JavaScript code and
				other libraries on the list below.</p>
			<p class="cms-filter about">CMS filter Finsweet multi-filtration helped us create a no-code filter system so that users could select
				agencies by
				preferred categories.</p>
			<p class="js">Playes JS by Vimeo we used it for the entire video content on the website. In addition, the library
				helped us implement
				Vimeo video launch with a click and hover.</p>
